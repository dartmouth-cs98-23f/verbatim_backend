This repository houses the backend code for our project.

## Architecture

In this project, we've chosen Spring Boot as our backend technology stack.

## Setup

Here are the steps to follow in order to run the initial 'Verbatim Backend' code:

#### For VS Code

1. Clone the 'verbatim_backend' repository.
2. After opening the repository in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the 'src/main/java/com/cs98/VerbatimBackend' directory.
3. Install the Java extension 'Extension Pack for Java'.
4. Right-click on the 'VerbatimBackendApplication.java' file and select the 'Run Java' option.

## Deployment

This is still something we need to figure out.
